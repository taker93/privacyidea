The token type *RADIUS* forwards the authentication request to a
RADIUS Server.

When forwarding the authentication request, you can
change the username
and mangle the password.

   *Enroll a RADIUS token*

**Check the PIN locally**

If checked, the PIN of the token will be checked on the local server. If the
PIN matches only the remaining part of the issued password will be sent to
the RADIUS server.

**RADIUS Server configuration**

The configuration of the RADIUS server to which the authentication request will
be forwarded. The configuration can be defined in :ref:`radiusserver_config`

**RADIUS User**

When forwarding the request to the RADIUS server, the authentication request
will be issued for this user. If the user is left empty, the RADIUS request
will be sent with the same user currently trying to authenticate.

**RADIUS Secret**

The RADIUS secret for this RADIUS client.

.. note:: Using the RADIUS token you can design migration scenarios. When
   migrating from other (proprietary) OTP solutions, you can enroll a RADIUS
   token for the users. The RADIUS token points to the RADIUS server of the
   old solution. Thus the user can authenticate against privacyIDEA with the
   old, proprietary token, till he is enrolled a new token in privacyIDEA. The
   interesting thing is, that you also get the
   authentication request with the proprietary token in the audit log of
   privacyIDEA. This way you can have a scenario, where users are still using
   old tokens and other users are already using new (privacyIDEA) tokens. You
   will see all authentication requests in the privacyIDEA system.
